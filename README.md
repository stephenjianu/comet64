# Comet 64 color scheme
A work-in-progress color scheme based on the default 2-color scheme of the game Comet 64 (https://store.steampowered.com/app/1397290/Comet_64/).
This color scheme is heavily inspired/influenced by the popular color scheme Solarized by Ethan Schoonover (https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/)
